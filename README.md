Graphs Notes

### What is a graph?
A graph is a collection of data represented by nodes and connections between nodes. 
* Trees can be considered a type of graph

#### Components required to make up a graph
* Nodes or vertices - represent objects in a data set (e.g., animals, cities, webpages, etc)
* Edges - they are connections between vertices, and they can be bidirectional.  An edge might be somethng like an animal group then all the subgroups below it. Not all edges are created equal so there might be a cost to traverse them.
* Weight - the cost to travel across an edge

#### What are graphs useful for?
* A city transit map.  For instance, a subway might use nodes to represent the stops.  The different trains we can think of as the edges. The weight might be how long it takes to get from one stop to another.
* Github could uses graphs to represent the push/pull history of a repo.

#### Specific kinds of graphs
* Directed graph - can only move along edges in one direction
* Undirected graph - allows movement in both directions along edges.
