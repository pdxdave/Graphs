Graphs Notes

### What is a graph?
A graph is a collection of data represented by nodes and connections between nodes. 
* Trees can be considered a type of graph

#### Components required to make up a graph
* Nodes or vertices - represent objects in a data set (e.g., animals, cities, webpages, etc)
* Edges - they are connections between vertices, and they can be bidirectional
* Weight - the cost to travel across an edge
